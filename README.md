> To-do  
    1. ~~CPU player implementation with minimax algorithm~~  
    2. Cleaner CSS with variables to implement multiple themes, and redo the off/on thing with JS .style.visibility to prevent overflow altogether, and then remove overflow: hidden from css.
    3. Include alpha-beta pruning into ai.js and make it reusable for a Connect-4 implementation  
    4. Maybe a suitable backend with socket.io to implement online multiplayer later on  
    5. PWA (logo, manifest.json, service-worker: cacheFirst)
