> To-do  
    1. ~~CPU player implementation with minimax algorithm~~  
    2. Cleaner CSS with variables to implement multiple themes  
    3. Include alpha-beta pruning into ai.js and make it reusable for a Connect-4 implementation  
    4. Maybe a suitable backend with socket.io to implement online multiplayer later on
